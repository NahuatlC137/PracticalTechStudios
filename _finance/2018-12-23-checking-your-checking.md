Who came up with that lame title? A post about the humble checking account.

How do checking accounts relate to personal finance? I tend to think of banks in two groups--brick-and-mortar and online banks.

Avoid national, brick-and-mortar, banks (more on local banks later). These banks tend to have a very low annual percentage yield (APY) or none at all, monthly fees, minimum balance requirements and are generally less convenient.

Online banks are increasingly popular. When I opened my Ally Bank account in 2014, I couldn't recall ever seeing or hearing of them. You can break online checking accounts into 2 groups, Interest and Cashback checking accounts.

Interest checking accounts work like a savings account in that they pay interest on a monthly basis without a limit on the number of transactions you make.

Cashback checking accounts work by paying you a percentage on the amount you spend on a monthly basis. Typically, the amount is capped around a couple thousand dollars.

Like any other banking product, interest checking accounts vary from bank to bank. Some do require a minimum balance to pay any or more interest while others are capped and pay a lessor percentage past a certain balance. In the case of cashback checking accounts, some transactions may not be eligible or on the other hand, may pay a higher percentage. Examples include purchases on gas or groceries.

In general, most online checking accounts:
1. Provide some sort of return (arguably).
2. Do not charge a monthly fee.
3. Do not require a minimum balance.

When I began educating myself on personal finance, I was sold just on the above characteristics. After all, I was fresh out of college, generally broke, had a job which didn't pay much and was constantly struggling to make ends meet. Not having to worry about a minimum balance or a monthly fee was outstanding.

Depending on the bank that you open an account with, the account may provide extra features which may or may not be beneficial to you. Capital One 360, for example, provide features which help in the event of an overdraft either by auto-declining, drawing from a savings account to cover the difference, tying to an overdraft line of credit or a next day grace period that allows you to cover the difference without being charged. Ally Bank has a feature which allows you to transfer money to family or friends through their Zelle feature. All major online banks allow you to deposit checks through a mobile app.

**So which is better--interest or cashback checking?** Through personal experience, I find that Cashback checking accounts work better for **me**. This is because I typically keep a cash balance of under $3,000 and I tend to spend a lot for bills or my real estate investments. However, if I were considering opening an account for a rainy day fund with a base of.. say $5,000 to $10,000--plus an additional balance for day-to-day expenses, perhaps an interest checking would be better suited, due to simply having a larger underlying balance.

So what if I happen upon some cash? If you are constantly working with cash, then it's probably best to establish a bank account with your local brick-and-mortar bank. You can then transfer the money online. You can also purchase a money order and deposit it to your account through the mobile app. Money orders at Wal-Mart are under a dollar. Lastly, you can incorporate it into your budget and spend it on groceries, gas or bills.

A quick note on small, local banks or credit unions. I follow the bigger pockets podcast and I've heard many investors say that establishing a relationship with your local bank or credit union will help you in the long run when looking to obtain financing. Take this with a grain of salt as I've never done it before but it sounds like a reasonable strategy.
