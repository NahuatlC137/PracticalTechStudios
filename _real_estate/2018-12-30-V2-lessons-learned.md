Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda...

In great part, my efforts at anything I do apart from my job is to get a better understanding of life and to nurture my endless pursuit of knowledge, both daunting and joyful efforts.

**Accounting** -- I knew accounting was important but there are characteristics of accounting which go unappreciated until you actually begin accounting for your project. I didn't record much for this project but I have some numbers I can work with.

1. Sum of Contractor expenses -     $6,800
2. Heating and Air -                $5,100
3. Fridge and Stove -               $1,100
4. Hardware store purchases -       $5,000
5. Miscellaneous -                  $2,000

Total Invested: **$20,000**

**Without proper accounting:**
1. Understanding returns is difficult.
2. Following a budget is difficult.
3. Knowledge on allocation of expenses is lost.
4. Incentives, such as a record of progress, are lost.

After paying for my mortgage, I'm left with $113.

$113 * 12 = 1,356$
